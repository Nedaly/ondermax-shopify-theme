# Release Process & Staging Deployment

## Release Workflow

### 1. Pre-Release Checklist
```bash
# Ensure you're on develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Run all quality checks
npm run lint
npm run format:check

# Test locally
shopify theme dev
# Verify no console errors and all functionality works
```

### 2. Create Release Branch
```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0

# Update version in package.json (if needed)
npm version patch  # or minor, major
```

### 3. Staging Deployment
```bash
# Set staging theme name
STAGING_THEME="staging-v1.0-rc1"

# Push to unpublished staging theme
shopify theme push --unpublished --path . --theme "$STAGING_THEME"

# Get staging theme URL
shopify theme list | grep "$STAGING_THEME"
```

### 4. QA Testing on Staging
```bash
# Document staging URL for QA team
echo "Staging URL: https://yourstore.myshopify.com/?preview_theme_id=STAGING_THEME_ID"

# Run final checks
npx theme-check
npx prettier --check .
```

### 5. Production Deployment
```bash
# After QA approval, deploy to production
PRODUCTION_THEME_ID="123456789"  # Replace with actual production theme ID

# Push to production theme
shopify theme push --theme-id="$PRODUCTION_THEME_ID"

# Or push to live theme (if you have permissions)
shopify theme push --live
```

### 6. Tag and Merge
```bash
# Tag the release
git tag v1.0.0
git push --tags

# Merge release branch to main
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.0.0
git push origin main

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge release/v1.0.0
git push origin develop

# Delete release branch
git branch -d release/v1.0.0
git push origin --delete release/v1.0.0
```

## Staging Theme Management

STAGING_NAME="staging-feature-hero-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
